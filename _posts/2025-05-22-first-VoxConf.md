The first VoxConf is happening!
We will do our first cozy conference this summer.
[NETWAYS](https://netways.de/) is generous and sponsors the location, the event will take place at [Deutschherrnstraße 15 - 19, 90429 Nürnberg (Germany)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?#map=19/49.453932/11.063257), on the 17th of July (Thursday), 2025.
The event will start in the morning and finish at noon.
It will be a single-track conference.

You want to speak about Vox Pupuli, Puppet, OpenVoxProject or anything related?
Submit your proposal, for a 25min or 45min slot, until the 20th of June at midnight, to [pmc@voxpupuli.org](mailto:pmc@voxpupuli.org).

You are wondering why this is a half-day event? As every year, the awesome [Foreman](https://theforeman.org/) people celebrate their birthday.
Their event takes place in the same location, at 1pm.
We're organizing the events after each other, so you have the ability to attend all talks, and we encourage you to do so.

You can find more information about the Foreman event [in their forum](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-birthday-event-2025/42996).

NETWAYS will soon provide a registration website for both events, and there won't be any fees.
The entrance will be free.

Vox Pupuli will sponsor a gettogether in the evening of the 16th of July, the evening before the conference.
We will also provide a travel fund with a total of € 5000.
Please write to the [PMC](mailto:pmc@voxpupuli.org) until the 20th of June at midnight, if (and how much) you require travel funding.
