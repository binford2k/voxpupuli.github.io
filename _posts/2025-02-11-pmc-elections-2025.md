As announced at CfgMgmtCamp last week, we are kicking off the more-or-less annual [PMC elections process](/elections/). This is a yearly process to provide more people opportunities to get involved with our leadership and decision making. Would you like to help set the first ever [OpenVox](https://github.com/OpenVoxProject/) roadmap or help architect OpenVox (Puppet) 9 features and support plans? Maybe you want to help organize events or help drive our social media presence. Do you love spreadsheets and want to help with accounting and fundraising? Maybe you'd like to help curate our blog or source content from writers?

Maybe you just want to get involved and help out with whatever is needed. Joining the PMC is your a great way to do all these things!

Starting today, you may nominate yourself or someone else for the [PMC](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/blob/master/share/governance.md#project-management-committee-pmc). Nominations are open until *23:59 UTC on 4 March 2025* and then we'll vote to select the 5 new members
of the PMC.

See the [elections page in our plumbing repository](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/blob/master/share/elections/2025-02.md) for nomination instructions.

I'll be your elections officer this year. I hope to see your PR soon! Feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns. I am GeneBean on both the Vox Pupuli & Puppet Community Slacks.
