For some years, Vox Pupuli operates a Slack<>IRC bridge.
We have been bridging the `#voxpupuli` on the Libera IRC with the same channel in the puppetcommunity slack.
We are finally able to bridge rooms in the Vox Pupuli Slack as well.
You can find an overview of all bridged rooms at [voxpupuli.org/connect](https://voxpupuli.org/connect/).
