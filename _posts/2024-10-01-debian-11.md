In the past, Vox Pupuli decided against supporting [Debian LTS timeframes](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS).
This was mostly because our CI resources were quite limited back in the days of Travis CI.
Over the time we got multiple requests from individuals and companies to also support Debian LTS, some of them even willing to sponsor us.
Some of our modules rely on a puppetserver or bolt, for example [puppet-redis][redis].
We're now in a situation where Perforce fails to deliver packages in time (see [1][1], [2][2], [3][3]).
This now brings us to a situation where normal Debian 11 support is gone, but we cannot add Debian 12 support for some modules because Perforce doesn't provide required packages.
Therefore we consider Debian LTS releases as supported.
