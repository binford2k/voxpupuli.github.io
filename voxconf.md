{: class="alert alert-success w-25 callout ms-3"  }

We will do our first conference this July, thanks to NETWAYS generously sponsoring the location.
This will be a single-track half-day conference.
We are sharing the space with the awesome Foreman people celebrating their birthday!
[Their event](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-birthday-event-2025/42996) takes place in the same location at 1pm so you can attend all their talks as well.

**Please submit your talk proposal** until the [20th of June at midnight](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20250620T215900&p1=tz_cest) to [pmc@voxpupuli.org](mailto:pmc@voxpupuli.org).

Suggested topics:

Time slots available:

We will also provide a travel fund with a total of ‚Ç¨ 5000.

### Hotel recommendations

In the past we had a good experience in the [Park Inn Hotel](https://www.radissonhotels.com/de-de/hotels/park-inn-nuernberg).
It's roughly in the middle between the event location and the main train station.
