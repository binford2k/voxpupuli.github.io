## The first VoxConf is happening!

üí°Watch this space for more information soon.
{: class="alert alert-success w-25 callout ms-3"  }

We will do our first conference this July, thanks to Netways generously sponsoring the location.
This will be a single-track half-day conference.
We are sharing the space with the awesome Foreman people celebrating their birthday!
[Their event](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-birthday-event-2025/42996) takes place in the same location at 1pm so you can attend all their talks as well.

**Please submit your talk proposal** until the [20th of June at midnight](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20250620T215900&p1=tz_cest) to [pmc@voxpupuli.org](mailto:pmc@voxpupuli.org).

Suggested topics:
- Vox Pupuli
- OpenVox
- the Puppet ecosystem
- _anything related_

Time slots available:
- 25 min
- 45 min

Netways will soon provide a registration website for both events, and there won‚Äôt be any fees.
The entrance will be free.

Vox Pupuli will sponsor a get-together in the evening of the 16th of July, the evening before the conference.
We will also provide a travel fund with a total of ‚Ç¨ 5000.
Please write to the PMC until the 20th of June at midnight, if (and how much) you require travel funding.
