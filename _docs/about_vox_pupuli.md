## Who can join?

Anyone can participate in voxpupuli. We currently have four levels of
participation, orchestrated by github teams.

* Everyone with a github account can submit pull requests and review code.
* Module contributors have commit/merge access to a subset of the modules in
  voxpupuli, usually the modules they maintained before joining
  voxpupuli.
* Collaborators have commit/merge access to a subset of the modules in
  voxpupuli.
* Administrators have the authorization to create new repositories and
  publish modules to the forge under the puppet namespace.

## Where you can find us

We have a number of communication channels:

* IRC: [#voxpupuli](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/#voxpupuli) on [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) ([webchat](https://web.libera.chat/?#voxpupuli))
* [#voxpupuli](http://puppetcommunity.slack.com/messages/voxpupuli/) on [Puppet Community Slack](http://puppetcommunity.slack.com)
* [Mailing List](https://groups.io/g/voxpupuli/)

IRC still counts as the preferred point of contact for many of us but we tend
to be available and reachable through both. If you need to reach out to a
maintainer because of behaviour in our community that you find questionable
please read through our [Code of Conduct](/coc), you'll find a contact address there.

Longer form cross-project discussion tends to take place on the mailing list,
as well as release announcements.

## Project management committee

We defined a [governance document](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/blob/master/share/governance.md#vox-pupuli-governance)
some time ago. It defines several different groups and roles. One of them is
the PMC. For 2019 [we
elected](https://voxpupuli.org/blog/2018/12/19/election-results-2019/) 5
people.

## Our Sponsors

At the moment Vox Pupuli has two sponsors.
[Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) sponsors us cloud instances to
run [voxpupu.li](https://voxpupu.li/) (our work-in-progress software to
automate daily tasks with the help of the GitHub API. See
[github.como/voxpupuli/vox-pupuli-tasks](https://github.com/voxpupuli/vox-pupuli-tasks#vox-pupuli-tasks---the-webapp-for-community-management)
for details).

GitHub
[sponsors us a Team Plan](https://voxpupuli.org/blog/2021/10/15/github-sponsors/)
for the whole organisation.

Thanks to both sponsors! They enable us to continue our work. If you would like
to sponsor us, in whatever form, please contact our
[Project Management Committee](mailto:pmc@voxpupuli.org).
