      OpenPuppet is the modern open source implementation of
      the world's most capable configuration management platform. It's trusted by
      everyone from the smallest hobbyist to operators of some of the largest
      commercial infrastructures in the business.
      </p>
      <p>
      Try OpenPuppet as the engine powering your infrastructure deployment and
      configuration needs and see why it's the industry standard in resource
      abstraction and drift remediation.

      OpenPuppet started life as a community maintained soft-fork of Puppet™️ in
      late fall of 2024. Perforce moved all further Puppet™️ development to
      internal forks of the public repositories and discontinued public packaging
      efforts. A community fork was the inevitable response.
      </p>
      <p>
      We call it a soft-fork because we intend to maintain downstream
      compatibility for as long as we are able. As such, we've created a
      <i>Puppet™️ Standards Steering Committee</i> to set the direction of
      features and language evolutions and have invited Perforce to participate.
