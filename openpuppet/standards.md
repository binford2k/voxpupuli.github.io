title: Puppet™️ Standards Steering Committee
subsection: openpuppet
---

OpenPuppet is backwards compatible with the Puppet language and configuration
files. As we evolve, we intend to do so in ways that benefit the whole community
of users, whether paid Perforce customers or open source OpenPuppet users.

To do this, we have established a standards steering committee which will make
all major roadmap decisions on features and language design to ensure the maximum
interoperability between the difference implementations of the Puppet standards.
As warranted, feedback from the broader community will be requested using
Vox Pupuli's standard lazy consensus model.

This group is made up of representatives from each of the major companies
participating in OpenPuppet's development, from the Vox Pupuli PMC, from
Perforce, and from interested members of the community.

- Two representatives from Betadots
- Two representatives from Overlook InfraTech
- Two representatives from Perforce
- Two community developers
- The Vox Pupuli PMC
