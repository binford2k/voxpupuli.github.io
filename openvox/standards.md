OpenVox is backwards compatible with the Puppet language and configuration files.
As we evolve, we intend to do so in ways that benefit the whole community of users, whether paid Perforce customers or open source OpenVox users.

To do this, we have established a standards steering committee which will make all major roadmap decisions on features and language design to ensure the maximum interoperability between the difference implementations of the Puppet standards.
As warranted, feedback from the broader community will be requested using Vox Pupuli's standard lazy consensus model.

This group represents the diverse interests involved in the project, from companies participating in OpenVox's development to Perforce to community users and developers.
