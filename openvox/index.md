      OpenVox started life as a Puppet™️ mirror by <a href="https://overlookinfratech.com/downloads/">Overlook InfraTech</a> to continue providing community packages when Perforce discontinued public packaging efforts in late Fall of 2024.
      It soon became clear that they were also moving all further Puppet™️ development to internal forks and ceasing development on open source Puppet™️.
      A community fork using Overlook InfraTech's packaging pipeline was the inevitable response.
      Soon after all work was moved to Vox Pupuli / to its <a href="https://github.com/openvoxproject">GitHub namespace</a> OpenVoxProject.
      </p>
      <p>
      We consider OpenVox a soft-fork because we intend to maintain downstream compatibility for as long as we are able.
      As such, we've created a <i>Puppet™️ Standards Steering Committee</i> to set the direction of features and language evolutions and have invited Perforce to participate.
