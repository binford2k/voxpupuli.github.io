      OpenVox started life as a community maintained soft-fork of Puppet™️ in late fall of 2024.
      Perforce moved all further Puppet™️ development to internal forks of the public repositories and discontinued public packaging efforts.
      A community fork was the inevitable response.
      </p>
      <p>
      We call it a soft-fork because we intend to maintain downstream compatibility for as long as we are able.
      As such, we've created a <i>Puppet™️ Standards Steering Committee</i> to set the direction of features and language evolutions and have invited Perforce to participate.
