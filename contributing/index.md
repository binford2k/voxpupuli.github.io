## Getting involved

Contributions are very welcome! We have hundreds of modules to care about, so any help is appreciated.
If you want to contribute, you can start by looking at the [list of issues](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Avoxpupuli+archived%3Afalse+sort%3Acreated-desc) and see if there is something you can help with.

We have a [mailinglist](https://groups.io/g/voxpupuli/), a [IRC channel](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697) and a [slack channel](https://puppetcommunity.slack.com/messages/voxpupuli/) where you can ask questions and get in touch with us.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. We are happy to help you.

## Monthly sync

We have a monthly sync meeting where we discuss the state of the project and what we want to do in the future. You can find the [meeting board](https://github.com/orgs/voxpupuli/projects/10/) here. The [zoom link](https://perforce.zoom.us/j/91219793310?pwd=M0pPRklhd0lhL2V6ZldQd1BZRCsvQT09) is always the same, so you can join us every month. We meet every second tuesday of the month at 15:30 UTC.
